# Medic - Support-Only Healer Addon for FFXI

A focused, support-oriented addon for Ashita v4 that automates healing, buffing, and debuff removal for select support jobs in Final Fantasy XI.

## ⚠️ Important: This is NOT a Full Automation Tool

**Medic is a support-only addon.** It provides healing, buffing, debuff removal, and basic pet management. It does **NOT** automate:
- Combat/attacking
- Tanking/enmity management
- Magic bursting/nuking
- Weaponskills
- Movement/positioning
- Full job automation

## Version 0.1.0 - Initial Support Release

This is the first official release focusing purely on support functionality.

## Configuration

Settings are saved per job in JSON format in the Ashita config directory:
- `settings_white_mage.json`
- `settings_summoner.json`
- `settings_dancer.json`
- etc.

### Common Settings

- `automation_enabled` (boolean): Automation on/off
- `focus_enabled` (boolean): Use focus target
- `focus_target_index` (number): Focus target party index
- `heal_enabled` (boolean): Enable healing
- `heal_threshold` (number): HP% threshold for healing
- `heal_aoe_enabled` (boolean): Enable AOE healing
- `heal_aoe_threshold` (number): HP% threshold for AOE
- `heal_aoe_count_threshold` (number): Min members needing heal for AOE
- `heal_pet_enabled` (boolean): Enable pet healing
- `heal_pet_threshold` (number): Pet HP% threshold for healing
- `wake_enabled` (boolean): Enable sleep removal
- `buff_enabled` (boolean): Enable buff maintenance

- `recover_enabled` (boolean): Enable MP/TP recovery
- `geo_enabled` (boolean): Enable geo management
- `geo_distance_threshold` (number): Distance threshold for Full Circle

## Design Principles

### Support-Only Focus
- No combat automation
- No tanking/enmity management
- No magic bursting or offensive spells
- Only healing, buffing, debuff removal, and basic pet management

### Configuration Over Code
- Jobs defined via configuration files
- No hard-coded ability names in core logic
- Easy to adjust per-job settings

### Safety First
- Multiple validation layers
- Automatic resource checking
- Cooldown tracking
- Event/cutscene blocking

### Performance
- Efficient party checking algorithms
- 1-second command throttle to prevent spam
- Early returns for disabled states

## Troubleshooting

### Automation Not Working

1. Check if automation is enabled: `/medic status`
2. Enable debug mode: `/medic debug`
3. Verify settings in config UI: `/medic config`

### Abilities Not Triggering

1. Check level requirements in job definition
2. Verify resource availability (MP/TP)
3. Check cooldowns with debug mode
4. Ensure thresholds are set appropriately

### Focus Target Not Working

1. Verify party member is active: `/medic focus <index>`
2. Check if member is in same zone
3. Enable focus in config UI
4. Use debug mode to see target selection

## Known Limitations

- Party only (no alliance support)
- Some buff IDs may vary by private server
- Requires Ashita v4
