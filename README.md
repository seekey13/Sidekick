# **Medic** - Support Job Automation Framework

A focused, support-oriented addon for Ashita v4 that automates healing, buffing, and debuff removal for select support jobs in Final Fantasy XI.  Tuned specifically for [CatsEyeXI private server](https://www.catseyexi.com/).

## New Collapsable UI

## ⚠️ Important: This is NOT a Full Automation Tool

**Medic is a support-only addon.** It provides healing, buffing, debuff removal, and basic pet management. It does **NOT** automate:
- Combat/attacking
- Tanking/enmity management
- Magic bursting/nuking
- Weaponskills
- Movement/positioning
- Full job automation

## Latest Updates

### [1.2.0] - 2026-01-18
- **Pet Entity Consolidation**: New `get_pet_entity()` function provides single source of truth for all pet-related operations
- **Job-Specific Ability Validation**: Jobs can now implement custom validators for fine-grained ability control (e.g., Summoner checks if Carbuncle is summoned)
- **Smart Summoner Pet Management**: Carbuncle-specific abilities (Healing Ruby, Healing Ruby II, Shining Ruby) automatically validate pet type; avatar-agnostic abilities (Avatar's Favor) work with any summoned avatar.  Added Apogee to `critical` Emergency abilities when Carbuncle is summoned.
- **Enhanced Code Maintainability**: Consolidated pet checking logic eliminates duplication across `has_pet()`, `get_pet_hp_percent()`, and `get_pet_distance()`
- **UI Component Refactor**: Extracted all UI rendering logic to dedicated `ui_components.lua` module (835 lines), reducing `config_ui.lua` by 52% for improved maintainability
- **Subjob Level Filtering**: Config UI now properly filters abilities by subjob level, showing only abilities available at your current subjob level


## Features

### Core Support Actions
- **Critical HP Response**: Emergency abilities (e.g., Divine Seal, Martyr) automatically trigger when party members drop below critical threshold (default 30%)

## Design Principles

### Support-Only Focus
- No combat automation
- No tanking/enmity management
- No magic bursting or offensive spells
- Only healing, buffing, debuff removal, recovering, and basic Geo pet management

### Configuration Over Code
- Jobs defined via configuration files
- No hard-coded ability names in core logic
- Easy to adjust per-job settings

### Safety First
- Multiple validation layers
- Automatic resource checking
- Status ailment detection (Silence/Amnesia)
- Cooldown tracking
- Event/cutscene blocking

### Performance
- Efficient party checking algorithms
- 1-second command throttle to prevent spam
- Early returns for disabled states

## Known Limitations

- Party only (no alliance support)
- Designed to work on [CatsEyeXI private server](https://www.catseyexi.com/)
- To target Trusts requires [Shorthand](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/Shorthand)
- To use attack range requires [Multisend](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/Multisend)
- Requires Ashita v4
