## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Critical HP Abilities**: New critical ability category triggers emergency abilities (e.g., Divine Seal, Martyr) when party members drop below critical threshold (default 30%, configurable 1-50%) before attempting regular heals
- **Button-Based Party Buff Targeting**: Single-target buffs now display ME/P1-P5 buttons for precise control over who receives each buff (e.g., Haste, Refresh, Protect, Shell, Enspells, etc.)
- **Trust Buff Tracking**: Buffs can now be tracked and cast on Trusts using packet-based detection (packets 0x028 for application, 0x029 for removal)
- **Group Dropdown Consolidation**: When multiple abilities exist in a group (e.g., Cure I-V), they are now consolidated into a dropdown selector for cleaner UI
- **Enhanced Casting State Detection**: Improved packet-based casting detection using offset 0x0F state byte (0x00 = casting started, 0x01+ = casting complete)
- **Subjob Duplicate Filtering**: Config UI now automatically hides duplicate abilities from subjob when they exist in main job (e.g., Cure spells)
- **Single-Target Buff Support**: Jobs can now cast single-target buffs on party members with intelligent uptime tracking and range validation (20 yalms)
- **Movement Blocking**: Casting is now prevented while the player is moving to avoid interrupted spells
- **Grouped Ability Management**: Only the currently visible ability in a dropdown group can be enabled; all others in the group are automatically disabled when dropdown selection changes
- **New Ability Default State**: All newly discovered abilities now default to OFF (disabled) until explicitly enabled by the player
- **Unknown Spell Button Protection**: ON/OFF buttons and party target buttons (ME/P1-P5) are now fully disabled (grayed out and unclickable) when a spell is not yet learned

### Changed
- **Healing Priority**: Updated healing priority to: Critical lowest HP (if below critical threshold) → Focus target → Regular lowest HP
- **Collapsible UI Sections**: All major feature sections (Healing, Buffs, Debuff Removal, etc.) are now collapsible headers with checkboxes for cleaner organization
- **Buff UI**: Single-target buffs (function commands) now use button-based targeting instead of checkboxes
- **Buff Logic**: Abilities are automatically enabled when any ME/P1-P5 button is selected, and disabled when all buttons are deselected
- **Party Buff Validation**: Added zone matching and range checking before casting buffs on party members
- **Casting State Logic**: Simplified casting detection to use action state byte only, not action ID, for more reliable state tracking
- **Party Buff Buttons**: Trust members now show disabled (dark gray) buttons in party buff UI to indicate buffs cannot be cast
- **Job Detection**: Moved job change detection from packet handler to automation loop for simpler, more reliable code (no longer uses packets 0x1B, 0x44, 0x1A)
- **Ability Default State**: Changed from enabled-by-default to disabled-by-default for all newly discovered abilities
- **Grouped Abilities**: Dropdown selection change now enforces single-enabled-ability constraint by disabling all other group members

### Fixed
- Button-based buffs now properly check if the ability is enabled before attempting to cast
- Party buff state correctly syncs with settings on button toggle
- Casting state now properly detects spell casting regardless of action ID changes between start and completion packets
- UI no longer shows duplicate abilities when same spell exists in both main job and subjob
- Grouped abilities now correctly maintain single-enabled constraint when dropdown selection changes
- Unknown spell buttons are now properly disabled and unclickable until spell is learned
