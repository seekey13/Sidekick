    Roll action module (Corsair)

    Maintains two configured Phantom Rolls and Double-Ups each one according to the
    configured risk tier (settings.risk_tier). Roll totals are not readable from
    memory, so they come from the 0x028 action packet (see roll.handle_action_packet
    at the bottom of this file).

    The Double-Up / Snake Eye / Fold decision math lives in lib/core/roll_strategy.lua
    (pure, self-testable); this module owns everything stateful around it -- packet
    totals, buff reads, throttles and command construction.

    Deliberately NOT gated on being engaged -- rolls fire out of combat too.
