    Rune action module -- Rune Fencer rune upkeep.

    Runes (Ignis .. Tenebrae) are eight status effects sharing one 5-second
    recast (recastId 10); more than one stands at a time -- 1 rune at RUN 5, 2 at
    35, 3 at 65. Lunge eats every rune the player holds, Swipe the newest one.
    Sidekick fires neither (they are damage); it only puts the runes back.

    Two kinds of row, both configured at the top of the UI's Buffs section --
    which is why buff_enabled gates the whole module. Idle Runes holds the slots
    normally; a rune-reading JA row (Vallation 10, Valiance 50, Pflug 40) takes
    them over as soon as its own recast is ready and swaps in its own set. The
    JAs only READ the standing runes (getAllRuneEffects / getHighestRuneEffect):
    none of the three consumes one, so the set is still up after the JA fires and
    Idle Runes swaps it straight back out. Out of combat the row still claims the
    slots and puts its runes up -- the prep is free -- but the ability itself is
    held until is_combat(), so a 300s recast is never spent on nothing.

    Vallation and Valiance overlap, but only one direction is a server rule:
    Valiance is a no-op on the CASTER while Vallation stands and spends its 300s
    recast anyway, so blocking it there is mechanical. Vallation the server lets
    land, silently stomping a standing Valiance (delStatusEffectSilent) -- blocking
    that one is Sidekick policy, since a 120s self-only Vallation is a downgrade
    from a 180s party-wide Valiance of the same potency. Liement (537) no-ops both
    for real. Handled by blocked_by in the job file plus
    action_core.filter_self_buff_blocked below; see CHANGELOG 2.8.0 for the detail.

    The settings-key helpers and ordered_ja are exported because lib/ui/config.lua
    draws the same rows and must agree with this module on every key and on the
    row order (as it already does with roll's reset_state).
